# Reconcile_inbox — the relay for questions that need a ruling

_Standing channel, opened 2026-08-18 (§325) at Battlewrath's ask. **The bench files items here;
the designer DRAINS them** — rules, reconciles the records against the outcome, and tests the
change against its impact. Kept short on purpose: an inbox that grows is one nobody empties._

## How it works

    THE BENCH FILES     a question it cannot settle alone, with everything needed to settle it -
                        options, costs, what is already built on an assumption, and the bench's
                        own read MARKED AS THE BENCH'S so it can be overturned in one word.
    ★ A TIE BREAK      is a DIFFERENT SHAPE (Battlewrath, §342): "tie break with instruction
                        instead of deliberation." When two governing docs disagree the rule has
                        ALREADY decided which wins - weighing them again is the builder doing
                        the thing the rule forbids. So it states the tie and lists INSTRUCTION
                        LINES to pick from. No bench read.
    THE DESIGNER DRAINS rules it · reconciles every record the ruling touches · checks the
                        IMPACT list below the item and says which parts actually moved.
    THE ITEM LEAVES     to §DRAINED at the foot with a one-line outcome and where it landed.
                        Removed entirely once the records carry it.

⚠ **An item is not a discussion.** If it needs a conversation it belongs in chat first and arrives
here as a question with options. **A row with no options is not ready to be drained.**

★ **Every item carries an IMPACT block**, because *"test against impact"* is the drain's second
half: a ruling that changes nothing on disk and a ruling that invalidates a shipped guard are
different events and should not look the same in an inbox.

⚠ **This file is a CHANNEL, not a governing document.** It directs nothing; it holds questions
until they are answered. `DRIVER_BASIS.md` is the authority and should carry a pointer to this so
nobody mistakes an open question here for a ruling.

## RI-17 · SENSE is location-and-behaviour; the export carries a DECLARATION, not a program

_Filed 2026-08-18 (§363) from Battlewrath in conversation, immediately after RI-15 drained.
**Three of the four points below are HIS, stated here so the record carries them; the fourth
is a reading of mine that he REFUTED, recorded so nobody builds it.**_

### What he said

**1 · SENSE is the LOCATION and the BEHAVIOUR whilst in its R.** Not "any player state."
The question is *am I inside this radius, and what am I doing while I am in it* — on me =
DURING, touched me = SEEN.

**2 · WHAT I DO states an OUTCOME, never a mechanism.** *"Boss is a few functions and actions
all together, the author is just stating the outcome of those functions. 'What I do: Boss kill:
Boss' — they don't build how that is performed."* ★ Which is why `bossEngaged` was struck: an
*engaged* witness is a step in HOW, not an outcome.

**3 · THE DRIVER HOLDS THE IMPLEMENTATIONS; THE EXPORT CARRIES A DECLARATION.** *"The
instructions that export do not carry each program instruction. The driver has that built in. It
just needs to be told `While:Boss:Bossname`."*
★ This is `routes.lua:20`'s own law made concrete — *"a route is DATA rather than code, a plot
table"* — and `While:Boss:Bossname` is what one line of that data looks like.

**4 · ⚠ FALLING AND IN-COMBAT ARE NOT INSTRUCTION SETS, AND NOT SENSES.** Battlewrath, refuting
a generalisation of mine: *"Not in-combat or whilst falling. Those would live in the wider logic
that needs something that gates on combat to be a condition."*
★ So the split is by KIND, not by capability: **boss kill is a composite program with an
OUTCOME**, addressed by name and argument; **combat and falling are GATES** — predicates the
wider logic uses when it needs one. They do not get an instruction-set address of their own.

### ⚠ MY READING, REFUTED — recorded so it is not rebuilt

I read `While:Boss:Bossname` as a general triple `While:<instruction set>:<argument>` and
extended it to `While:Falling:` / `While:InCombat:`. **Wrong**, per (4). ★ The tell is my own
standing failure mode: I took something true — the boss declaration's shape — and carried it one
step past the evidence into a taxonomy. There is no evidence that every driver capability is
addressed the same way, and (4) says two of them are not.

### ⚠ WHAT THE RECORD SAYS TODAY, AND IT DISAGREES

RI-15's own drain and model §2 both carry the older list in the same breath as the ruling:

> **SENSE is always THE PLAYER** — *"sense the player"*: here, **falling, in combat, alive,
> mounted** — only what the client reports about the player.

Under (1) and (4) those are not senses. ★ A10.3a is already compatible — it names only
`reach here` and says *"only senses that EXIST are offered"* — so the disagreement is confined
to **RI-15's example list and model §2's line**, and those are exactly what a SENSE REGISTRY
would be seeded from.

### The open piece — how the declaration is STORED

Today a boss child holds **two loose fields set by two functions** — `child.sense = "bossKilled"`
(`routes.lua:932`) and `child.boss = name` (`routes.lua:968`) — and **the scope word is nowhere
at all**; it is implicit in the row being a DURING row. That is three parts of one declaration
living in three places, which is the shape that lets two drift apart and still render.

    a  ONE FIELD, THE WHOLE DECLARATION. The row stores its condition as a single addressable
       thing the store holds whole, the export carries whole, and the driver reads whole.
       ★ It also makes a partial export impossible rather than unlikely.
    b  KEEP THE PARTS, ADD A READER. Leave the fields and compose the declaration at the export
       boundary. Cost: the composing rule is a second place the shape is known.
    c  PARTS PLUS SCOPE. As today, plus the scope written down rather than implied by which
       row-list the row sits in.

**Bench read (overturnable):** **(a)** — because (2) and (3) say the declaration IS the unit the
author authors and the driver consumes, and a unit that only exists when something assembles it
is a unit with an assembler that can be wrong. ⚠ Flagged rather than taken: it changes what
`SetChildSense` / `SetChildBoss` / `ArmsWith` are, and A3's rows and their mutations read those.

    IMPACT
      on disk now      routes.lua (SENSES · SenseOf · Sense · SetChildSense · SetChildBoss ·
                       ArmsWith) · store.lua's schema hook (A8.4 migrates stored boss values
                       either way) · object.lua's sense dropdown · smoke A3 block
      shipped guards   A3.1-A3.5 read the field; under (a) they read ONE field instead of two,
                       same values, same picker rule, same no-refusal law
      criteria         A3.x · A10.3a's registry ("what it carries") · RI-15's example list ·
                       model §2's sense line
      does nothing to  A10.1 (frame · floor · seating, all green), the note, the ordinal

# DRAINED (2026-08-18, Battlewrath; records reconciled by the Analyst)

    RI-1  THIRD WAY — referenced in the store, owned in the pane. §91 survives; sharing a note
          across children is a later re-point. → acceptance A4.2 names the world; G1 unblocked.
    RI-2  THE SPLIT — `ReachOf` raw (nil = author set nothing); consumer resolves ±2.5. UI: a
          slider the author TICKS to change, with light text ("changes the height of
          detection"); the SAME control shape for the two radii — radius:listen (come here) and
          radius:sense (found). → acceptance A1.3 reworded; model §3 defaults carry the UI note.
    RI-3  "walk" has meant two things and they separate: the author IN THE WORLD hitting their
          waypoints = TEST DRIVE → its own suite entry INSIDE Dungeon Run (option b), an
          extension of the editor's play pacer; an ASSURANCE piece (offline replay, the py walk,
          per-node fitment) = the test/debug/diagnostic suite. → acceptance A6.1 home = test
          drive; W-tests stay the diagnostic side. `/dr walk` is not revived.
    RI-4  BEST WORKING MODEL (his "unsure exactly"): a node carries created-from (origin data
          point) and current; origin is METADATA once not current. On import to another
          author's editor, **ONLY THE RID IS RE-MINTED** — past the RID everything is unique to
          it, so `BID:CID` carries unchanged (no full waterfall). Place carries as current;
          metadata OUTSIDE identity/place (notes, radii, bands, names) SURVIVES; the origin-on-
          someone-else's-data does NOT travel — the import landing becomes the new origin. So
          export-trims governs, the ledger's round-trip law compares against the MINT CONTRACT
          (identity · place · properties), one-door and zero-trust untouched. → DRIVER_BASIS
          positions; ledger §5.9–5.11 want a banner (bench); addressed store / RID may proceed.

    RI-5  DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18) — the two thresholds are ACTIONS at distances, not
          sense types. (1) one anchor, two (action, distance) pairs = TWO TABS -> two steps in the
          flat form. (2)/(3) `sense` = the KIND (reach here + distance · boss engaged/killed ⟨name⟩
          · falling · in combat); there is NO firing field — time lives in WHAT I DO as an
          open/close pair, DURING (whilst on) | WHEN OFF, plus IF SEEN (once | every) as its own
          control; G15 (`while`) IS that pairing. Advance / set are ACTIONS in what-I-do, per tab;
          no separate "what happens next"; a beacon-level next exists only for a childless beacon
          (with children the beacon is not in play — its FIRST CHILD acts as the beacon: lure +
          note; last delete; tabs return to the parent; completion SHED to any child; taste: the
          parent is the biggest node, children are the discrete placeable ones). Position is the
          NODE's, not on the pane. → model §1 (beacon), §2 head; acceptance A2.5 (new); A1.1's
          pure-accessor change UNBLOCKED; `sense`'s shipped VALUES and the A3 block STAND (RI-15:
          the values, not the field — boss moved off `sense` to the what-I-do row's condition).

    RI-6  DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18) — (a) the CID counter stays ROUTE-SCOPED, as the
          code ships. His reason: fewer MISFIRES and less REFERENCING — one global press that
          takes the beacon ID and stamps its running count; (b) would have to look up the
          beacon, count its history, then mint. Identity = `RID:BID:CID`; the full path is
          unique because RID is; only RID re-mints on import (RI-4). No migration for CIDs;
          A8.4 covers the RID alone. Stage/ordinal are properties, never identity; merged-by-
          stage beacons split cleanly because children are referenced through their parent.
          Two beacons on one stage is an authoring collision — TOLD (red "match N"), NEVER
          locked; the driver degrades deterministically and states it (bench). → BASIS
          positions; acceptance A8.4 note; nothing else moves.

    RI-7  DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): `activate` GONE with goTo — it stored another
          node's identity (outward pointing on the mechanical test); the ordinal sub-ratchet is
          the hand-off. Model §2 box struck; scoping §117 superseded by steps (BASIS). If a
          satellite ever must jump the chain: `set step N` (a number). No code deleted.
    RI-8  DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): `onRamp` GONE in the same commit — a second
          mechanism for one fact. Entry = childless beacon → the beacon; with children → the
          FIRST CHILD (acts as the beacon; the lure; can be step 1); then whatever the author
          laid out fires (ordinal 1 sensed / a satellite first). Co-location for the rare
          separate-lure case. Custody comment, chip, 3 interface rows, 2 functions removed.
          **His framing of what survives: UPDATERS and ORDINAL — and both beacons and children
          have both now** (a beacon: ordinal on the stage line, or a non-ordinal updater =
          recovery/boss; a child: ordinal = step, or non-ordinal = satellite/updater).
    RI-9  DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): **BUILD IT — I-2. S8 REVERSED by him as a
          reversal, dated:** notes are IN v1. S8 gets the supersession note; A4 proceeds as
          written (RI-1: referenced in store, owned in pane); G1 stays in the standing order
          (before the test drive); model §5's G1 correction is itself corrected back.

    RI-10 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): SEPARATE SHELF — the route note plane, its own
          table under the personal one (§60); export takes it whole, never the personal plane
          (structural, no tag). WORDS: "personal note" / "route note" — "reader" rejected (a
          reader is anyone reading either, author or consumer). LABEL the author sees: "Route
          instructions" (one adaptor row: term `route note` → label "Route instructions";
          "note" reads as a dev-note slot on first read); "Personal note" stays; ghost text
          "Instructions for the player running the route". PERSONAL NOTES SCOPED (model §4b): a player using
          both addons; per-place, role/class-specific experience; shown in a DESIGNATED SLOT
          beside the route note during runs, by position; may push the tracker by explicit act,
          the route overwrites; how routes become lessons learned; off the authoring path; never
          travel. → acceptance A4.2 reworded (the Analyst's wrong-shelf owned); model §4b;
          target §4 two slots. **G1 UNBLOCKED.**

    RI-11 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): (d) NOW — the check_rects canvas is a RED, not an
          option (acceptance A9.6). a/b/c DEFERRED TO THE OVERHAUL: "argumentation over UI
          placement is out of place when we know it needs an overhaul." Until then the checker
          NAMES the three hand-placed controls as unverified (never counts them clean).
    RI-12 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): (b) — A4.2 reads "closed except the travel half";
          the two-tables assert stays as the structural guard; the travel assert lives in A8.5
          when export lands. The roster's covered count tells the truth.
    RI-13 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): NOT OPEN — RI-10 already ruled the label "Personal
          note"; the OWED adaptor row is implementation of a drained ruling. Relabel when the
          personal-note pane work happens; ghost text "Your note — stays with you, never
          travels." No reversal.
    RI-15 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18) — NEITHER option; the class dissolved rather than
          got a better name. **SENSE is always THE PLAYER** ("sense the player": here · falling
          · in combat · alive · mounted — only what the client reports about the player). **Boss
          is NOT a sense** — "while (duration) is the arming to listen to CLEU, and boss is the
          CLEU". **WHAT I DO = "when the player is here": a STACK of rows, each an ACTION
          (give note · advance · set stage · set supertracker · /say · open list) with an
          optional CONDITION (on boss ⟨name⟩ engaged | killed; default immediately)**, the
          whole stack scoped by the sense — "what you do only has meaning when you're in the
          location to do it." Boss child reads: sense here (during) → advance, on boss ⟨name⟩
          killed; listener armed only while the sense holds; a wipe re-arms, nothing advances
          on leaving. → model §2 (reframed-again block) + §3 defaults; A3 heading + A3.2 + NEW
          A3.5 (armed only while sense on) + migration by the A8.4 hook; adaptor boss rows =
          the row's condition; A10.3a/A10.3d; A10.2a corrected (fold the three that survive,
          the rest REPLACED by A10.3). IMPACT moved: `Routes.SENSES` boss pair → the row's
          condition (settable SENSE list is empty until a state sense lands; the registry
          carries family + what it carries; only detectable senses present); SenseOf/
          SetChildSense/ArmsWith re-seated; object.lua's sense dropdown + SENSE_TEXT (RI-16's
          lookup); smoke A3 block reads the new field, same values. (b) OUT — falling waits on
          capture. RI-5's closing clause now reads "the shipped VALUES stand".
          SETTLED (same day, three turns on): a row = CONDITION + ACTION + optional INLINE
          STAGE END, every row SELF-COMPLETING (no "then" between rows; the stage tail is the
          only tail and it completes via the entry lure — stale arrow closed); the author's
          condition is KILLED only (engaged = driver witness at most); a kill row DEFAULTS to
          set stage = this beacon's next, ABSOLUTE from the node's own stage (recovery; S6's
          "Boss killed → set:stage(N)"), advance +N beside it; fields depend on the choice.
          → model §2 second block · A3.2 rewritten (+ two mutations) · adaptor `bossEngaged`
          struck · A10.3a. "step" = the ordinal child ("a minor stage, a small gear");
          actions are not steps; the no-ordinal UPDATE type child stays, same as a beacon.

    RI-16 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18) — (a) YES: the RUNTIME LOOKUP lands BEFORE the
          first fold — one lookup function over one CONSTANT table on the UI side (`code →
          user`), pass-through on a miss; ROLE_TEXT + SENSE_TEXT retire into it; A5.1/A5.2 smoke
          rows filled. Not a deviation (A10.2a orders folds among themselves — the brief's
          omission, Analyst's). (b) fails A5.3 outright. (c) provenance = a tooling item that
          FOLLOWS (generate the constant from driver_adaptor_table.md; A5.3's 1:1 check is the
          guard until then). → A10.2 PRECONDITION line; A5.1/A5.2 unchanged in wording.
          Same turn, on the row model: A CHILD COMPLETES WHEN ALL ITS ACTION TABS HAVE
          COMPLETED — a CONSTANT, no control (note fired + kill pending = not complete; the
          ordinal does not hand off). → model §2 · NEW A2.7.

    RI-14 DRAINED (Battlewrath, 2026-08-18): keep the HEADSTONE in routes.lua; the acceptance
          composition lives ONCE at the CALL LAYER, outside routes.lua, swept by the smoke
          (A1.2's invariant covers every site that goes through it). No source-text scanner.
          `<Noun>Of` accessors stay pure; a composer IN routes.lua would be the branch renamed.

_Items above leave entirely once every record named carries them._
